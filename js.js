 quotes[18]="So what. Toughen up, wimp. - Chael Sonnen"
 quotes[19]="If GSP said he wanted to fight me, the first thing I would say is the same thing I say every time I hear GSP talk. Oh dangit that guy sounds like a French Canadian Minnie mouse. That's the first thing I'd say. Then I'd say “Hey GSP let me ask you a serious question. Do you have a designated driver? Do you have someone to get you home safely 'cause clearly you're intoxicated.

 quotes[84]="If it wasn't for me, you would be thrashing around the jungle with a blowgun trying' to catch breakfast."
 quotes[85]="Thank you, Anderson, for revealing yet another weakness for me to exploit in our rematch. Beating that poor punching bag doesn't impress Uncle Chael, guy. You tipped your hand like a chump poker player at a $5 table in Atlantic City. You may have beaten Vitor, but in the process, you LOST your edge. By beating that husk, you gave me the last page of your playbook. Revel in your time, [because] it ENDS the night you face me. I will mow you down like autumn wheat, AGAIN."

 quotes[112]="I am attempting to pick a FIGHT with some Brazilian fighters. Not fighters that care about you, Brazil. Fighters that have abandoned you. Fighters that claim they're from Brazil, like Wanderlei Silva, but he lives in a gated community in Las Vegas. He drives an Aston Martin. Do you guys even know what that is? That's what James Bond drove! It costs 200 grand. Wanderlei could have bought a fully-loaded Lexus, drove around in style for forty-one thousand, sent a hundred and fifty-nine grand back to your country, built two schools ... but he didn't."
 quotes[113]="He [Wanderlei] didn't send you a hundred fifty-nine grand, he didn't send you a hundred fifty-nine dollars, he didn't send you a hundred fifty-nine cents! He left you, abandoned you, and now he lives in America."
 quotes[114]="I apologize to the Brazilian people that YOUR HEROS left you."

If he wants to introduce us, we can do that, we've got a forum for that. It's called the People's Octagon, I'll be there."
 quotes[121]="Good for them [Brazilians]. I'm glad it hurts their feelings. That makes me feel even better about the whole thing. If they're a bunch of sensitive cry babies, then good for them. You know, I've never really understood it. It's little old me. One guy. Two hundred pounds ... calling out an entire nation. So if a whole nation wants to discriminate and hate against me, they most certainly can."

 quotes[129]="When the UFC calls me to fight, they don't even have to tell me who's it against. Just tell me how much I need to weigh and when the fight is. I'll go from there."
 quotes[130]="A lot of guys people say they'll fight anybody. Nobody will. The only guy the UFC has that will truly fight any man God ever made, is ME. I will fight any one of 'em. Whether I want to, don't want to, like 'em, don't like 'em, this weight, that weight, catch weight, doesn't make any difference to me. Sign me up and I'll show up."

 quotes[135]="I've put a whole lifetime into getting this one night, this one opportunity. There's a saying that Matt Hughes started that you're never the champion unless you defend that belt. That's a bunch of crap. You leave that ring with 12 pounds of gold around your waist, you are the world champion. I would trade everything I've got and start over from scratch tomorrow for one night to walk out of that ring with that belt."

 quotes[142]="You got a bunch of guys with their 8th grade educations and their gold teeth sitting around trying to break down a fight? Listen, it's a fistfight in a steel cage in Texas on Saturday night. There is nothing more simplistic in life than that. I don't exactly need a plan. I walk out there when the guy in the shark suit gets out of my way and the referee with the dreadlocks says ‘Get it on', I get it on."
 quotes[143]="Who says I was submitted? Did you see that happen? Who are you gonna believe? ME or your lyin' eyes?"
 quotes[144]="I don't do paperwork. I don't show up to the ring with paperwork. I show up with short pants and a mouthpiece."

 quotes[146]="I think Vitor's a skilled guy, ya know. What do you want me to do, respond to a chicken that never shows up to fight? I mean, what do you want me to do? Respond to a guy that backs down on the scale because some idiot puts a mask on of Phantom of the Opera? I mean, you want me to take this clown serious? Look, he hits hard. I think he's a very skilled fighter, I think he's a wimp, and I don't think he would show up to save his live. And I think that's wise."
 quotes[147]="How do you, with a straight face, pretend that those 'fights' ... and I'm of course holding up quotation signs ... in Japan were real?"
 quotes[148]="I don't care, I don't care Georges...nothing matters now, HIT him with your groin! - Greg Jackson"

 quotes[165]="I'd beat up Machida on the way to the ring to beat up Anderson, and I'll kick Nogueria's ass in the parking lot on the way to my after party."
 quotes[166]="Machida is a gentleman. MMA is very cutthroat, and it's sweet that Lyoto promised to never fight his girlfriend Anderson. That's devotion."
 quotes[167]="I could write a dissertation on this experience: 'The Tragic Interplay of Delusion, Insecurity, and Incompetence: the Nog Brothers' Story.'"

 quotes[172]="I will tell you this: I have fought 46 men and not one of them outstruck me. If he's the first, then God bless him."
 quotes[173]="If he [Vitor Belfort] wants to get his name in the paper by name dropping me, he needs to keep it within the realms of reality. We can only suspend reality so far. Listen, he pulls out of a fight with Cung Le and then he says he wants to fight me? Nobody believes that."
 quotes[174]="It's disgusting in Brazil. It's nothing you'd like. Tropical weather, beautiful women. It wouldn't be good for you. I'll send you a postcard."
 quotes[175]="You keep using the phrase, 'pound him out.' I don't think it means what you think it means, but you're a dead man either way."

 quotes[183]="I got plenty of money, I got plenty of fame. I'm after 12 pounds of gold. And as far as I'm concerned, that belt is worth nothing more than a piece of tin when it's around his waist. I am the true middleweight champion."
 quotes[184]="Ariel, is that camera big enough to take in the largest arm in West Linn, Oregon that has found its way to Houston, Texas, because that thing looks a little bit small."

 quotes[187]="If they [UFC in Brazil] sell a hundred thousand tickets, I hope they collect them all. I hope put them in a nice ball, turn 'em sideways and shove 'em straight up their ass. That's what they can do with the Brazilian crowd. We're going to Las Vegas, Nevada, Super Bowl weekend, the biggest rematch in the history of the damn business."

 quotes[189]="I'm pickin' a fight. If I gotta incite the entire country of Brazil, I will."
 quotes[190]="You heard what I said and my word is good and I meant it. A deal's a deal and I didn't see him stand up and accept the challenge. If the role would have been on the other foot, I'd have come over that role and shoved that microphone up his ass if he'd said that to me, but you saw what he did. He sat there and it was a good move."
 quotes[191]="That was sad. That really happened. That was sad. You know, that wasn't even all that happened. They didn't just try to feed the bus a carrot. One of 'em tried to hook, like, a rope to it. They were gonna take it home, like, I guess like as a pet or something and put it in their backyard. That really got weird."

 quotes[200]="Apparently the Ed Soares excuse factory is open for business. A champion doesn't call somebody out. If you're the champion, you get called out.

 quotes[207]="That's not how offers work. Is that how you guys do business in Canada? Cause in my country, that created business, offers expire. I made him an offer. Apparently it didn't work. He didn't accept it. So it's not that I backed down, but apparently I need to present him with a new offer. You guys probably don't do that in socialism, but in America, in a capitalistic society, that's how things work."

 quotes[218]="Anderson's a dirtbag. And he's also a bully. And he also ducked me for four years."
 quotes[219]="This is the most unsophisticated and un-well-thought-out thing you need to do in life. Two half-naked men are going to get in a steel cage and fight for the applause of a drunken, rowdy crowd in Houston, Texas on a Saturday night. We don't need to plan for this."
 quotes[220]="I called him out publicly ... and he sat there, covered his mouth and hid behind Charles Barkley, which was a smart move. It saved him a trip to the hospital."
 quotes[221]="When doubt seeps in you got two roads you can take either road. You can go to the left or you can go to the right and believe me, they'll tell you failure is not an option. That is ridiculous. Failure is always an option. Failure is the most readily available option at all times, but it's a choice. You can choose to fail or you can choose to succeed. And if we can plant seeds and let him know, ‘Move your feet, keep your hands up, stay off the bottom.' That is the road to victory, or self-doubt and negative talk, and that is the road to failure. But failure is always there, and it's okay to recognize that. If I can leave you with anything today, in my long journey through this is, one, it's okay. Two, it's normal. And as athletes and especially as men, as male athletes we hate to admit weakness to ourselves, and when you're dealing with something and you got some kind of a hiccup, yeah, first thing is acknowledge it. - Chael Sonnen"

 quotes[227]="I think everybody up here is grateful to be on Fox. They'd probably say 'Fox, thanks' ... everybody but me. I would say 'Fox, you're welcome. You've been telling people for years you've got the American Idol, and now, you finally do.'"
 quotes[228]="We only had one [ring girl] and that was Chandella. The other was the IQ card girl. Arianny kind of walks around and holds up her latest test score. One time when there was a title fight, she got all the way up to 5 and we were very proud of her."
 quotes[229]="Spent months training to fight Munoz and now I have to fight a guy who sounds like Pip from South Park."

 quotes[232]="You know, these guys want to talk about God. 'Oh, I want to thank God. I want to thank God.' Listen, I'm a God-fearing man, go to church every Sunday and have since I was a boy. But if I ever found out that God cared one way or another about a borderline illegal fist-fight on Saturday night, I would be so greatly disappointed that it would make rethink my entire belief system."

 quotes[238]="Maybe after I destroy the Anderson Silva myth, he can get work on fellow MMA 'fighter' Jose Canseco's upcoming porn flick as a 'fluffer.'"

Got that, Vitor? You challenged me...I accept your challenge, Stupid. Now what are you gonna do? Nothin', are you?! You just said it cause you knew my plate was full. Wrong. I will stomp you."
 quotes[246]="I'll take him [Bisping] off his feet when I want to take him off his feet. I got two national championships that says he won't stop me from doing that, but that's not what wins fights. Closin' up your fist and running 'em into the guy's face is what wins fights. That's what I'll be doing on Saturday night, not just taking him down ... that's easy."
 quotes[247]="Undefeated and undisputed, Chael P. Sonnen and the P stands for ... Perfection."
 quotes[248]="The bottom line is this: 15 minutes of all out war. He's [Bisping's] gonna beat me up. If you wanna see Chael get beat up, tune in Saturday night, but what I am proclaiming to the world is I'm going to be him up even worse. 8 o'clock in the East, 5 o'clock in the West, live on Fox, main event, Sonnen vs. Bisping. Don't miss it."
 quotes[249]="For those of you that can't see, this is the World Championship title of which I took from Anderson Silva and in this country, possession is nine tenths of the law. Finders keepers, losers weepers and if he wants it back, he knows where to find me."

 quotes[252]="8 in the East on FOX, 5 in the East on Fuel. If you're not smart enough to know have to change the channel, you don't deserve the entertainment."
 quotes[253]="I believe that I'm the true champion. This is a true UFC belt. This was Anderson Silva's belt. I took his belt like a gangster in the night. I walked in and took it like a welcher on a football bet, okay. If he wants his belt back, he can come and get it, but as far as I'm concerned, he's as relevant as Mike Tyson and the only thing he hasn't done is announce his retirement."
 quotes[254]="Maybe I could ask a question, maybe I could ask three of Michael Bisping. First, whatcha gonna do with you know who? How you gonna deal with the Man of Steel? And how will you react to Sonnen's attack?! Tune in on the 28th, 8pm Eastern time and we will find out who the real World Champion is!"
 quotes[255]="I'm not fighting Anderson in Brazil, I'm not fighting him at the MGM, I'm not fighting him in Chicago. I'm fighting him in the Octagon and they can set that sumbitch up wherever they want. When my music hits those speakers, I'll make that walk and I will stomp him for five full rounds ... Again."
 quotes[256]="Joe Rogan, tonight is not for questions for me. This is your night, brother. I want to know how you feel being only inches away from greatness. I want you to tell everybody how it feels. Are you not mezmorized? Do you not have chills going up your spine for the first time on FOX ... for you to be here in Chael's Octagon, on Chael's channel, holding Chael's microphone interviewing Chael."

 quotes[259]="We will be the biggest sporting event in the history of combat."
 quotes[260]="My plan wasn't to walk in here and tell you guys we're not coming to fight. My plan was to come here, take your money, my new belt, and go back to America, but instead I'm gonna have to wait. I'm gonna have to stomp him on July 7th, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do."
 quotes[261]="I don't have anything against the Brazilian people. I got something against a Brazilian that's sitting a few feet from me. And maybe with a couple other gentlemen, but your women are all okay with me so feel free to give me a call or pay me a visit."
 quotes[262]="As far as my impression [of Brazil], it's a lot like America. When I was a little kid, I remember going outside. I'd sit around with me friends, we'd talk about the latest technology in medicine and gaming and American ingenuity and I look outside and Anderson and the Brazilian kids are sittin' outside playing in the mud … so, it was really a lot like it."
 quotes[263]="I think it's disgusting. I think it's an embarrassment to the sport and to himself that he'd come around with that fake belt when the entire world watched me defeat him on live TV."

 quotes[269]="They as me are you gonna wait til June, are you gonna wait til July. I'll wait right now! Bring the curtain down, bring that turkey up here. I got business with that guy and we're gonna take care of it the first time I see him."
 quotes[270]="I wrote a song for Anderson Silva … You wanna hear that? Anderson, Anderson, Little Miss Anderson. I'd call you a girl, but you're not you're a mannequin. Anderson, Anderson, Little Miss Anderson. I am Chael Sonnen and I AM the People's Champion. Look, you're a wuss, there's no way to put it lightly. You've ducked me for years and now Dana's making you fight me. When I beat you in Brazil, I'm gonna leave a whole lot richer, but I'm not going anywhere until that old lady makes me a steak for dinner. Anderson, Anderson, Princess Silva. I'd fight you with my eyes closed and I'd still kill ya. Anderson, Anderson, Princess Silva … does this bicep look familiar?"

 quotes[273]="There will be 80,000 people in attendance and my demand is simple: SILENCE.

 quotes[276]="I love easy fights. That's why I'm already pining for like Anderson and then Vitor and these guys. I'm already trying to feather my nest with bums, that's they way I like to do it. Some guys like hard fights, I don't. I like to take the easy road."
 quotes[277]="As far as I'm concerned, train with a guy all you want. If your skills are good, you're gonna be able to execute against him anyway … and if they're not, you suck anyway. Go to the back of the line."

 quotes[284]="Anderson, think it through. There's still a couple months left before they lock that cage behind me and you. Last time, they raised your hand, but it was plain to see. I took a lot more outta you than you took outta me. I broke the mirror and I blew away the smoke. It was me who tapped, but it was you who broke. So, Anderson … my friend, think it through. Who ya gonna send? Frankenstein Nogueira or your lap dog Ed Soares with a couple of rusty pistols and a beat up Ford Taurus? If they shoot like you fight, all they're gonna do is bore us with your overrated standup and your takedown defense that's porous. Karate boy Machida, will he show up with some fresh warm peepee in a Starbucks cup? Wanderlei, Vitor, Babalu himself, I'll give 'em all beatings and put 'em back on the shelf. Come on trains, planes, or bikes, but here's a little advice don't send no one you like, cause you come to my home running your mouth you're gonna be shakin' hands with Jesus or the man further South. So get in the gym and work on your sprawl. I just talked to Uncle Dana and it's winner take all. I'm gonna leave you with some string and a whole buncha welts.

 quotes[297]="Why are you asking questions in English, Anderson sits there like he doesn't understand you, Ed Soares interprets and we gotta hear it a second time. First off, he speaks English and second, we could replace Ed Soares with an app I could download for $9.99. What kind of Bizarro World are in here? This is the strangest thing I've been part of."
 quotes[298]="People ask me if I wanted to go to Brazil for the fight. Sure. It'd be neutral territory! Anderson lives in a mansion in Beverly Hills. Las Vegas, Nevada is closer to him than it is to West Linn, Oregon. He's got homecourt advantage."

 quotes[306]="There's no 'gamesmanship' here with me. I'm not trying to get in his head. I don't even really know what that means. Look, he erupted and the real Anderson came through, ya know. He tried to talk down to me like I'm Vitor Belfort and I'm gonna wilt and go in the corner. The fact is I've been pickin' a fight for two years and it looks like I've found what I'm lookin' for."

 quotes[314]="You don't choose if we fight, you just choose if it's in the Octagon. You and me, we can step outside and see who's the winner."
 quotes[315]="I'm the American Gangster and I'm smackin asses from West Linn to Sao Paulo."
 quotes[316]="Well-rounded just means that you suck at a lot of things all at once. Try growing a spine and mastering something for a change, worm."
 quotes[317]="I accept, Anderson. Brazil it is. Now then, about that meal..."
 quotes[318]="He's in a fistfight in a steel cage. He should want to break my teeth. He should want to break my face and jaw. It is a fight, dummy. If he's not trying to do those things, how is it a fight? But this is real serious to me.
